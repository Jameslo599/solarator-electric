## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery

I had the incredible opportunity to connect with Darryl and collaborate on the creation of a website aimed at driving more clients to his business. Darryl, a proud US veteran with a background as a Naval Electrician, was keen on emphasizing both his military service and the fact that he's a locally-owned, black-operated business. Additionally, I had the privilege of crafting a brand-new logo that perfectly satisfied his vision.

Upon landing on the website, visitors are greeted with Darryl's new logo, prominently displayed above the business name, slogan, and call-to-action buttons. Notably, I integrated a captivating video background into this project, showcasing an aerial view of multiple naval aircraft carriers to underscore Darryl's Naval background. Navigation is made seamless through a right-sided menu bar that leverages jQuery for smooth scrolling to the desired sections. As users scroll down, elegant information boxes about Darryl and his business gracefully fade into view alongside captivating images of his work and an embedded custom Google Maps service area. Further down the page, a captivating parallax image of a navy battleship ties together the overarching theme of the site.

The services section offers a comprehensive array of the services Darryl offers to his prospective clients. Some of these services are linked to articles that I've regularly penned on his behalf, both to provide valuable information and enhance search engine optimization. Eventually, all service selections will be interconnected. As users continue to scroll, they encounter a section highlighting the core values of the business, featuring picture cards with the Navy logo that smoothly slide into view. Moving further down the page, we present customer reviews adorned with images overlaid on a clean white background, lending the page a charming rustic aesthetic.

The website also incorporates a standard contact form, which I meticulously designed to cater to the diverse needs of businesses. Similarly, the footer boasts a range of essential components, including social media links and accepted payment methods, making it a one-stop destination for all essential information.

## Optimizations

To boost the website's loading speed, it is advantageous to optimize image resolutions for select images and minimize unnecessary JavaScript that hinders the website's rendering process. I rely on Google Tag Manager for all my business websites, which has, at times, caused substantial obstructions in rendering. I am actively addressing this issue to enhance the website's performance.

## Lessons Learned:

Darryl is one of the most pleasant people I've had the chance to work with. He provided me with an opportunity to further strenghten my front-end abilities while receiving an effective business site in return.
